Whenever you need me， I'll be here。 Whenever you're in trouble， I'm always near。
Whenever you feel alone， and you think everyone has given up。。。
Reach out for me， and I will give you my everlasting love

I just wish someday and somehow，We can be back together， Together we'll stay，Always and forever。

houghts of you dance through my mind。 Knowing， it is just a matter of time。Wondering。。。
will u ever be mine?You are in my dreams， night。。。 and sometimes。。。 day。
The thoughts seem to never fade away。 Corwin Corey Amber
